## Overview

One of the greatest barriers to adoption of NFV today is the ability to bring in the functionality of various Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in to the NFV architecture.

## Try it out

A. Download latest code base

    On a Linux system make a directory e.g. mkdir vnf_onboardding
    Navigate to that directory
    Execute command ‘git init’
    Execute command "git clone https://github.com/vanlittle/VNF-Onboarding.git"
    Change directory to "VNF-Onboarding/" . Latest code should be available in "Gen\ 3"
    Copy "Gen\ 3" contents to a directory where application will be deployed.

B. Run “npm install” from “mwc-nfv-hackathon/wizard”

    In case of problems you can try:

    nodejs node_modules/node-sass/scripts/install.js

    npm rebuild node-sass

    In case , “npm install” fails with error

    “ npm ERR! No compatible version found: gulp@4.0.0-alpha.2 “

    Change gulp version in “mwc-nfv-hackathon/wizard/package.json” to 4.0.0

C. Install Postgresql Database

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

D. Configure Database settings

1.Access a Postgres prompt

$ sudo -u postgres psql postgres

2.Change Password for "postgres" user postgres=# \password Enter new password: Enter it again: postgres=#
E. Update username and password in the “database.ini” file located at ‘mwc-nfv-hackathon/backend/

     [postgresql]
     host=localhost
     dbname=postgres
     user=
     password=
     [vnf_onboarding]
     dbname=vnf_onboarding_tool_db
     host=localhost
     user=
     password=
     [Details]
     table=vnf_onboarding_tool_users 
     **  if “user” in [vnf_onboarding] section different than default postgres user then user needs to **
    **be created manually**

F. Install Python requirements

**Install requirements**
  pip install -r mwc-nfv-hackathon/req.txt
